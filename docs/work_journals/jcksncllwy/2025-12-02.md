# Work Journal - December 2, 2025

**Developer:** Jackson Callaway (@jcksncllwy)
**Focus:** Fastlane Release Automation (Issue #10)

---

## Complete Fastlane Setup

**Fastlane Installation & Configuration**
- Installed Fastlane via Gemfile
- Created comprehensive Fastfile with lanes for:
  - Version bumping across all platforms (package.json, app.json, Android, iOS)
  - Android AAB builds with keystore signing
  - iOS IPA builds with App Store Connect API
  - Combined release workflow
  - Git tagging and commit automation
- Added NPM scripts for convenient release commands
- Auto-generated README.md documentation

**Google Play Service Account Setup**
- Created Google Cloud project: `amplifyaudiobooks-api`
- Enabled Google Play Android Developer API
- Created service account: `fastlane-release@amplifyaudiobooks-api.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- Downloaded JSON key and stored in `android/google-play-key.json`
- Granted admin permissions in Play Console (Users and permissions)
- Updated documentation with 2025 Google Play setup process (old docs were outdated)

**App Store Connect API Setup**
- Generated API Key in App Store Connect
- Key ID: `6ZN29XPT4Z`
- Issuer ID: `b42c1557-1cbc-4d99-82e9-26b28023c64b`
- Downloaded and stored key file in `ios/AuthKey_6ZN29XPT4Z.p8`
- Provides full API access (including build listings, unlike app-specific passwords)
- Commented out app-specific password to avoid authentication conflicts

## Bug Fixes

**Bundle Identifier Consistency**
- Found inconsistency: app.json and Appfile had `org.reactjs.native.example.AmplifyAudiobooks`
- Correct bundle ID verified in App Store Connect: `com.sevenstar.amplify`
- Fixed both files to match actual bundle ID

**Android Build Signing Issue**
- Initial Android build failed due to Fastfile overriding signing configuration
- Problem: ENV variables for keystore were passed to gradle, creating invalid path
- Solution: Removed signing properties override from Fastfile
- Now uses existing `keystore.properties` configuration
- Fixed keystore path in keystore.properties (was doubled: `app/app/...`)

**Documentation Updates**
- Fixed all references from `.env` to `.env.development` (actual file used)
- Updated Google Play setup with 2025 process (Settings → Users and permissions)
- Changed hardcoded ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS to placeholder per user feedback

## Testing Results

**Version Bump Testing**
- Tested bump from 2.2.0 → 2.2.1, build 7 → 8
- ✅ package.json updated correctly
- ✅ app.json updated correctly
- ✅ Android build.gradle versionCode and versionName updated
- ✅ iOS project files updated via agvtool
- Successfully restored back to 2.2.0/build 7

**Android Build Testing**
- ✅ AAB build successful: 41MB output
- ✅ File location verified: `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
- Build time: ~2 minutes

**iOS Build Testing**
- ✅ IPA build successful: 21MB output
- ✅ File location verified: `build/AmplifyAudiobooks.ipa`
- Build time: ~9 minutes
- Some deprecation warnings but no errors

**Not Yet Tested**
- ⏳ Actual deployment to Google Play Console (`fastlane android deploy`)
- ⏳ Actual deployment to App Store Connect (`fastlane ios deploy`)
- ⏳ Full release workflow with manual CHANGELOG.md step
- Plan: Test deployment with next patch version (2.2.1)

## Branch & PR Management

- Created `feature/fastlane-automation` branch
- Opened PR #12 with comprehensive documentation: https://github.com/seven-stars-software/amplify-audiobooks-react-native/pull/12
- Stashed android/app/build.gradle versionCode change (3 → 7) for main branch
- Switched to main and committed versionCode update separately
- Committed Fastfile fix with auto-generated README.md

## Available Commands

```bash
# Version bumping
npm run release:version version:X.Y.Z build:N

# Building
npm run release:build-android
npm run release:build-ios

# Deploying (untested)
npm run release:deploy-android
npm run release:deploy-ios

# Full workflow (untested)
npm run release
```

## Working Directory Management

- Encountered issue where I was in `android/` subdirectory, causing ls commands to fail
- User noted this isn't the first time this has happened
- Reviewed `docs/claude-guide.md` which already documents best practices:
  1. Always prefer absolute paths
  2. Use subshells `(cd dir && command)` when directory change required
  3. Never use standalone `cd` unless chained with return
- Committed to following these rules more strictly going forward

## Files Modified

- `Gemfile` - Added Fastlane dependency
- `fastlane/Fastfile` - Created comprehensive automation lanes
- `fastlane/Appfile` - Fixed bundle identifier
- `fastlane/README.md` - Auto-generated by Fastlane
- `app.json` - Fixed iOS bundle identifier
- `android/google-play-key.json` - Service account credentials
- `android/keystore.properties` - Fixed keystore path
- `ios/AuthKey_6ZN29XPT4Z.p8` - App Store Connect API key
- `.env.development` - Updated with all credentials
- `docs/FASTLANE_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide
- `package.json` - Added release scripts
- `android/app/build.gradle` - versionCode update (committed to main)

## Key Learnings

1. **Google Play API setup changed in 2025** - Now under "Users and permissions" not "API access"
2. **App-specific passwords have limitations** - Can't list builds, use API Key for full functionality
3. **App Store Connect API Key is superior** - Provides full programmatic access
4. **Don't override signing in Fastlane** - Use existing platform configurations (keystore.properties)
5. **Working directory discipline matters** - Follow absolute paths and subshell patterns
6. **Test incrementally** - Version bump → Build → Deploy (stopped before deploy for safety)
