# Work Journal - November 25, 2025

**Developer:** Jackson Callaway (@jcksncllwy)
**Focus:** v2.2.0 Release Day & Atomic Design Refactoring

---

## Morning: PR Review & Merge

- Reviewed and addressed PR #7 issues
- Fixed PlaybackProblemScreen null check (issue #7)
- Confirmed download FAILED status persistence (issue #6 was false alarm)
- Merged PR #7 to main

## Midday: Release Prep

- Tagged v2.2.0
- Updated version numbers in all build files
- Bumped app.json to 2.2.0

## Afternoon: Platform Releases

**iOS Release ✅**
- Built, archived, uploaded to App Store Connect
- Distributed to TestFlight for beta testing

**Android Release 🚨**
- Hit keystore crisis - original keystore lost in March 2024 rebuild
- Discovered Google Play App Signing enabled (good!)
- Generated new keystore: `amplify-audiobooks-release.jks`
- Extracted certificate: `upload_certificate.pem`
- Becky (account owner) submitted upload key reset request to Google Play
- Status: Waiting 2-48 hours for approval

## Evening: Architecture Work

- Comprehensive architecture review
- Discovered Atomic Design compliance issues (~40% misclassified components)
- Created `refactor/atomic-design-compliance` branch
- Reorganized 10 components (atoms → molecules → organisms)
- Created `src/components/organisms/` directory
- Updated 21 files with corrected imports
- Wrote comprehensive `docs/ATOMIC_DESIGN.md` documentation
- Branch ready to merge when convenient

## Infrastructure

- Configured Android signing with keystore.properties
- Added `*.jks`, `*.pem` to .gitignore
- Updated release process documentation
- Created issue #10 for Fastlane automation
- Created `.claude/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for session continuity

## Key Learnings

1. **Always back up keystores** - Losing them blocks releases
2. **Google Play App Signing is a lifesaver** - Can recover from lost keystores
3. **Account owner permissions matter** - Only owners can reset upload keys
4. **Atomic Design needs discipline** - Easy to misclassify components as they grow
5. **File-based memory helps Claude** - PROJECT_CONTEXT.md maintains continuity
