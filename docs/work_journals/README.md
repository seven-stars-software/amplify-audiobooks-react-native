# Work Journals

This directory contains individual work journals for project contributors. Each contributor maintains their own journal files to track daily work, decisions, and learnings.

## Purpose

Work journals serve to:
- Document daily work and decisions for future reference
- Maintain project continuity across Claude Code sessions
- Track key learnings and architectural decisions
- Provide context for code reviews and PRs
- Help onboard new team members

## Format

Each journal entry should include:
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD format in filename
- **Developer:** Name and GitHub username
- **Focus:** Main work areas for the day
- **Sections:** Organized by topic or time of day
- **Key Learnings:** Important insights or decisions

See existing entries for examples.

## When to Create Entries

- After significant work sessions
- When making architectural decisions
- After completing features or fixing complex bugs
- When learning something important about the codebase
- Before context switches or long breaks

## Benefits

- **For you:** Easier to remember what you did and why
- **For teammates:** Understand recent changes and decisions
